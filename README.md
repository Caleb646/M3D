# M3D

## Summary
M3D is a math library that supports matrices and vectors of variable size (only square matrices as of right now) inspired by [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm). It allows for column or row major ordering as well.

## Getting Started
Since M3D is a header only library simply adding it to your include path is all you need to do.
